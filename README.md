# CS1010 Programming Methodology Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the CS1010 Programming Methodology module at the National University of Singapore. Each program is implemented in C and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts taught throughout the course.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following C source files:

1. **`digits.c`**: A program that performs operations of digit recognition and utilises Machine Learning concepts.

2. **`inversion.c`**: A program that calculates the number of inversions in a sequence (Sorting).

3. **`marks.c`**: A program that processes and analyzes students' marks.

4. **`maze.c`**: A program that solves mazes.

5. **`sort.c`**: A program that implements sorting algorithms.

6. **`sudoku.c`**: A program that solves Sudoku puzzles.

7. **`valley.c`**: A program that identifies valleys in a dataset.

## Getting Started

To compile and run any of the programs:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ariff1422/CS1010.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory**:

   ```bash
   cd CS1010
   ```

3. **Compile the desired program**:

   ```bash
   clang -o program_name program_name.c
   ```

   Replace `program_name` with the name of the program you wish to compile (e.g., `digits`, `inversion`).

4. **Run the compiled program**:

   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- A C compiler, such as `clang` or `gcc`.

- A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux).
